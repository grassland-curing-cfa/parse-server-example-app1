### Prepare for multiple local repositories for multiple Parse-server-example instances

* Clone the original Parse-server-example project using the [parse-server](https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server) to a local directory where you want to store the potential repositories, e.g. "C:\Work\tmp\"

  git clone https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server-example parse-server-example-app1
  
  Cloning into 'parse-server-example-app1'...
  
  remote: Counting objects: 135, done.
  
  remote: Compressing objects: 100% (19/19), done.
  
  remote: Total 135 (delta 10), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 116
  
  Receiving objects: 100% (135/135), 29.00 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
  
  Resolving deltas: 100% (61/61), done.
  
  Checking connectivity... done.
  
* Change the current working directory to your local project, e.g. "C:\Work\tmp\parse-server-example-app1\".

* Go back to GitHub under your own account

* Create a new repository and name it "parse-server-example-app1" on GitHub; this repository will host the code for the cloned repository locally as above steps

  URL to the new repository on GitHubhttps://github.com/grassland-curing-cfa/parse-server-example-app1.git

* Now let's push the cloned local repository to the GitHub repository by running the following commands. Reference document: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1221840/remote-origin-already-exists-on-git-push-to-a-new-repository

* git remote -v

  This shows the current URLs for both "fetch" and "push" for the current "origin"; they should now still be connected to "https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server-example"
  
* git remote rm origin

  This should disconnect from the old repository "https://github.com/ParsePlatform/parse-server-example"
  
* git remote add origin https://github.com/grassland-curing-cfa/parse-server-example-app1.git

  This should connect to the new repository that was newly created as above.
  
* git push -u origin master

  This should push the cloned repository locally to the new remote repository on GitHub. Enter Username and Password for your GitHub account.

  Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.





### For Local Development

* Make sure you have at least Node 4.1. `node --version`
* Clone this repo and change directory to it.
* `npm install`
* Install mongo locally using http://docs.mongodb.org/master/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
* Run `mongo` to connect to your database, just to make sure it's working. Once you see a mongo prompt, exit with Control-D
* Run the server with: `npm start`
* By default it will use a path of /parse for the API routes.  To change this, or use older client SDKs, run `export PARSE_MOUNT=/1` before launching the server.
* You now have a database named "dev" that contains your Parse data
* Install ngrok and you can test with devices

### Getting Started With Heroku + Mongolab Development

#### With the Heroku Button

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

#### Without It

* Clone the repo and change directory to it
* Log in with the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) and create an app: `heroku create`
* Use the [MongoLab addon](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/mongolab): `heroku addons:create mongolab:sandbox`
* By default it will use a path of /parse for the API routes.  To change this, or use older client SDKs, run `heroku config:set PARSE_MOUNT=/1`
* Deploy it with: `git push heroku master`

### Getting Started With AWS Elastic Beanstalk

#### With the Deploy to AWS Button

<a title="Deploy to AWS" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home?region=us-west-2#/newApplication?applicationName=ParseServer&solutionStackName=Node.js&tierName=WebServer&sourceBundleUrl=https://s3.amazonaws.com/elasticbeanstalk-samples-us-east-1/eb-parse-server-sample/parse-server-example.zip" target="_blank"><img src="http://d0.awsstatic.com/product-marketing/Elastic%20Beanstalk/deploy-to-aws.png" height="40"></a>

#### Without It

* Clone the repo and change directory to it
* Log in with the [AWS Elastic Beanstalk CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3-install.html), select a region, and create an app: `eb init`
* Create an environment and pass in MongoDB URI, App ID, and Master Key: `eb create --envvars DATABASE_URI=<replace with URI>,APP_ID=<replace with Parse app ID>,MASTER_KEY=<replace with Parse master key>`

### Getting Started With Microsoft Azure App Service

# Using it

You can use the REST API, the JavaScript SDK, and any of our open-source SDKs:

Example request to a server running locally:

```
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: myAppId" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"score":1337,"playerName":"Sean Plott","cheatMode":false}' \
  http://localhost:1337/parse/classes/GameScore
  
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-Parse-Application-Id: myAppId" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}' \
  http://localhost:1337/parse/functions/hello
```

Example using it via JavaScript:

```
Parse.initialize('myAppId','unused');
Parse.serverURL = 'https://whatever.herokuapp.com';
var obj = new Parse.Object('GameScore');
obj.set('score',1337);
obj.save().then(function(obj) {
  console.log(obj.toJSON());
  var query = new Parse.Query('GameScore');
  query.get(obj.id).then(function(objAgain) {
    console.log(objAgain.toJSON());
  }, function(err) {console.log(err); });
}, function(err) { console.log(err); });
```

Example using it on Android:
```
//in your application class

Parse.initialize(new Parse.Configuration.Builder(getApplicationContext())
        .applicationId("myAppId")
        .clientKey("myClientKey")
        .server("http://myServerUrl/parse/")   // '/' important after 'parse'
        .build());
        
  ParseObject testObject = new ParseObject("TestObject");
  testObject.put("foo", "bar");
  testObject.saveInBackground();

```

You can change the server URL in all of the open-source SDKs, but we're releasing new builds which provide initialization time configuration of this property.
